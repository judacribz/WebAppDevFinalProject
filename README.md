## Objective of our project
To show students what class rooms have classes in them at the moment. If the classroom, the student is interested in, has a class going on. This was our goal to mitigate the over crowding in the library and UA fish bowls and divert the student traffic to classrooms in the North Campus buildings that do not have classes going on (that the user of the website can determine by looking at the list)
